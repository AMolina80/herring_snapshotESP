Indicator (units),Status,Implications,Time Series,w,h
Winter NAO (Index),WinterNAO anomalies have been positive in 2024 and 2025,"NAO phases impact oceanographic properties of water entering the Gulf of Maine. Easily updatable, data publicly available [8]. Could be replaced by other indices of climate variability or SOE indicators (such as Gulf Stream Index)",winter_nao_2025-08-20.png,3,1
Haddock Predation (Index),Declining predation on herring eggs,Lower egg predation favors strong year classes. Tailored indicator developed by Micah Dean at MADMF for the RTSA. Alternative indicator:haddock SSB from the stock assessment model,haddock_predation_index_2025-08-20.png,3,1
Optimal larval temperature duration (# of days),Short duration of optimal larval temperature in fall 2024,"Unsuitable conditions for larvae. Easily updatable, data publicly available. Based on larval thermal limits and OISST data, using herring spatial footprint.",temp_duration_2025-08-21.png,3,1
Commercial Landings (millions of lbs),Well below average,"Commercial landings remained relatively static compared to 2023 and are slightly higher than 2020-2022 quantities; however, landings are still well below the historical average as well as the standard deviation from the mean. ",Commercial_Landings_millions_2025-08-26.png,3,1
Average Price per lb. (2024 $/lb),Well above average,"Ex-vessel price was well above the historical average in 2024. Given no notable uptick in landings, this increase may be driven in part by supply constraints, particularly for Area A1 which had a 92.1% of its quota landed by December of 2024 [9]. ",Price_per_Pound_2025-08-26.png,3,1
Active Vessels (# of vessels),Well below average,"The number of active vessels in the herring fishery declined from 2023 to 2024, following an overall decreasing trend since 2017, suggesting overall negative implications for fishing fleet diversity and resilience. ",Active_Vessels_2025-08-26.png,3,1
Average Vessel Revenue (2024 $),Below average,The average revenue per vessel from herring landings  increased slightly from 2023 and has continued a positive trend since 2021. This is most likely due to a lower number of vessels in the fleet and potential increases in effort from those remaining in the fishery to maintain relatively consistent landings relative to previous years. ,Vessel_Revenue_per_Year_2025-08-26.png,3,1
